    <strong>‚úÖ Description: </strong>
    <p>An android application was developed using the flutter framework to create an onboarding screen, some of its functionalities are: </p>
	<ul>
      <li>The user can slide to the right to continue to the next part of the onboarding.</li>
      <li>The user can slide left to go back to the previous part of the onboarding.</li>
      <li>The user can click on the "Next" button to proceed to the next part of the process.</li>
      <li>When all parts of the onboarding are shown, the button text will change to "start" and if the user clicks on it, a new screen with the text "welcome" will be shown.</li>
    <li>The "shared_preferences" dependency has been used so that the onboarding is only shown once, if the user closes the app and reopens the app, the "welcome" message will be shown.</li>
    </ul>
   <strong>‚úÖ Dependencies used: </strong>
  <ul>
      <li>hexcolor (^3.0.1): This dependency was used to handle hexadecimal colors (https://pub.dev/packages/hexcolor). </li>
      <li>shared_preferences (^2.0.9): This dependency was reduced so that the onboarding screen is only shown once to the user, when he closes the app, it will show the message "welcome" the next time he opens the app (https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences). </li>
    </ul>
